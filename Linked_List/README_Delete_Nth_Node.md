/* A Java program that deletes a nth node from a Linked List using slow and fast pointers The given linked list 2 > 3 > 1 > 7 > 5 > 18 > NULL is used to create an algorithm that deletes the third last node from the end of the list and returns the new linked list. This program assumes that the programmer does not know the full length of the list and follows the O(n) time and O(1) space complexity and only completes a single pass through the list. This is completed by creating two pointers: fast and slow. While the fast node passes through the list, the slow node will stop and remove the nth node from the end of list and therefore, accomplishing the task. This program uses a Linked List in order to utilize the .next.next properties of pointers to find the nth node from the end of the list. The nth node can be altered by int n value so if you would like to find the 2nd or 4th node, the algorithm should be able to find it. Output should be the linked list with the element 7 dislodged.
