/* A Java program that demonstrates the use of linked list data structure by reversing the order of the current list This program contains a node constructor which forms the basis for the linked list. It features a reverse method that takes in a node parameter and initializes three pointer variables: previous, current, and next. The while loop checks that the current variable is not null and continues to reassign values for current to the previous and so forth. I also created a printList method taking in a node parameter to print out node data as the previously mentioned method traverses. My main method creates a new linked list called "obj" which contains 3 nodes: 1,2,3 which in typically order will begin with 1, point to 2, and so on. The main method prints out the original list order. Afterwards, the reverse linked list prints from the new head and calls the reverse method created previous. This method assumes that the list is no more than 3 elements as additional nodes must be added to allow for larger lists.
