/* A Java program that finds the nth smallest element utilizing the Tree data structure The class to represent the tree node and tree nodes are given. This program is meant to return the third smallest element in the Binary Search Tree which follows the O(n) time complexity. The code can be altered from changing the nth value so if you would like to find the second smallest, change the n in the main class to 2 instead. I created three seperate functions called insert(), nth smallest() and printnthsmallest(). The insert() function allows me to utilize keys instead of having to initialize each tree node on seperate lines. The nth smallest() function creates a base case which returns when the root is null, checks the left subtree and prints out the nth smallest is found, or else, checks the right subtree to find the nth smallest element is found and returned. The printnthsmallest() prints out a message that there are less than n nodes if the tree does not have enough nodes to find the nth smallest such as there being 3 nodes and you're looking for the 4th smallest element; else, the method recursively calls the result. In the main function, I initialized the root to be null, declared the tree nodes as keys and for the length of the nodes, calls the insert and print nth smallest functions, printing out the result which, in this case, is 3.
