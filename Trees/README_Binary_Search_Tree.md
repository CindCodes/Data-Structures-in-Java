/* A Java program that utilizes a specific way to delete the root node of the binary search tree while maintaining the binary search tree property after deletion Implementation accomplishes two tasks. First, the program deletes the root node value of the Binary Search Tree and replace the root value with the appropriate value of the existing Binary Search Tree. Second, the program performs the Binary Search Tree status check by doing an in-order traversal of the Binary Search Tree such that even after deletion the Binary Search Tree is maintained. When the deletion process and BST traversal is followed, the time complexity, O(n) and space complexity, O(n), is maintained.
