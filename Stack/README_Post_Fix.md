/* A Java program which solves a post-fix expression using the Stack data structure For this program, I utilized the Stack data structure to create a calculator that sorts expressions in the string into two categories: operands and operators. When an operand is found, the algorithm sorts the element into a stack which utilizes first in first out management method. When an operator is found, the algorithm pops out two values from the stack and depending on the operator type, applies the given operation to compute the value and pushes it back into the stack until the whole expression is iterated. The following algorithm follows a O(n) time and space complexity. This algorithm assumes that the expression is Post-Fix and might not work for in-fix and pre-fix expressions.
