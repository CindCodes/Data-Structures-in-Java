/* A Java program that determines if an array is a subset of another using the Hash data structure This program utilizes the HashSet structure to determine if a given array is the subset of a larger one, that being, if an array exists entirely in the other. To accomplish this, I created two hashsets called arr1 and arr2. which uses the .add() function to add elements to each set and .containsAll() function to check if the array 1 contains all the elements found in array 2. If all the elements in array 2 are in array 1, the boolean will return true for the result variable and print out a "yes, it is" statement. Else, the result will return false and thus, prints out "no, it is not." This program uses the built in hash functions of .add() and .containsAll().
