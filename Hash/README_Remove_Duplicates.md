/* A Java program that removed duplicates in an array using the Hash data structure For this specific program, I took advantage of the non-duplicate feature of HashSets and used it to create a new hash set called "set" and only added elements in it if the element did not already exist since HashMaps allow for duplicates and HashSets do not. This algorithm assumes that the input array is already sorted; if I were to implement this to an integer array that isn't already sorted, I would need to create another function with a sorting algorithm such as binary search. Nevertheless, the algorithm takes the input array and removes duplicates in O(n) time and O(n) space complexity using the HashSet data structure. The output is [1,2,3,4,6]. The program works with any input integer array that is already sorted.
