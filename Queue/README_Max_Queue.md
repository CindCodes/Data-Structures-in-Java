/* A Java program that utilizes a Queue data structure to design a Queue that meets O(1) lookup time to find the maximum element. The program implements this design using the ArrayDeque class in Java. The program maintains two queues, a main queue which contains the array elements and a max queue which holds maximum values from the main queue. The max queue would be a double ended queue that would be able to remove elements from both ends. To lookup the maximum value, theprogram checks the front of max queue which ensures O(1) lookup time. While de-queing elements, the program checks if they are equal to the front of max queue and if so, the program dequeues from the max queue too. The program follows the max queue lookup time complexity of O(1) and max queue space complexity of O(n).
